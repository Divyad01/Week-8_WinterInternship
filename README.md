# Fitbit Data Analysis Capstone Project

## Overview

This project involves the analysis of Fitbit data to extract insights into users' activity patterns, sleep quality, and overall health. Python is the primary tool used for data analysis, employing libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and NumPy.

## Project Structure

- **data**: Contains the raw Fitbit data file in CSV format.

- **notebooks**: Jupyter notebook used for the entire data analysis process, from data loading to exploration and visualization.

  - `fitbit_capstone_project.ipynb`: Notebook encompassing the complete data analysis workflow.

## Data and Resources

The raw Fitbit data file is available on Google Drive. You can access it by clicking [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1J2-X4n46w0XYbAfY4SqwmPnNx9KhbLCC). Please download the necessary data files and place them in the `data` directory before running the analysis notebook.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.8
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib numpy jupyter
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone the project repository.

2. Navigate to the project directory.

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
